# Hardware Overview

This section covers all physical components that make up an OpenShock setup â€“ from the control board ("Hub") and transmitter modules, to the shockers (collars) themselves and the remotes you may already own.

Use this page as a map. Dive deeper via the links below depending on what you want to build, buy, identify, or maintain.

## Recommended Starting Hardware

If you are new and buying fresh parts today:

1. A fully maintained board (e.g. Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3, Wemos Lolin S3, or OpenShock Core V2)
2. A 433 MHz transmitter module listed in the Transmitter section
3. A recommended shocker (CaiXianlin) â€“ see supported list

Recommended: Cables & Soldering Iron to connect the ESP32 and Transmitter.

## Safety First

Before powering anything or placing a collar on a person, read the core [Safety Rules](../home/safety-rules.md). Improper use can cause injury. Never place electrodes near the heart or neck; avoid simultaneous contact with both shocker pins.

## Firmware & Flashing

Once you have your board selected, head to:

- [How to Flash Your Board](../guides/openshock/how-to-flash-your-board.md)
- [First Setup](../guides/openshock/first-setup.md)
- [How to Update](../guides/openshock/how-to-update.md) for OTA / version upgrade workflow

## Compatibility Labels

The meaning of the icons used in board/shocker tables:
